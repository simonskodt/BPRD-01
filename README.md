# 'Programmer som data' assignments

Here, we have gathered all of our assignments in the 5th semester course 'Programmer som data' (eng: 'Programs as data'). We specify our own lexer and parser in order to construct our own programming language.

## Important files

The files `fslex.exe` and `fsyacc.exe` are loaded into the environment variables such that we have do lexing and parsing on our language.
